This project focuses on pattern mining and association rule learning using the FOODmart_2025_DM.csv dataset, a modified retail dataset representing transactions from different store types. The goal was to discover global and local purchasing patterns across various store categories (e.g., Deluxe, Gourmet, and Small Grocery stores).
The analysis involved identifying frequent itemsets, association rules, and maximal itemsets using metrics such as support, confidence, lift, leverage, and conviction, to extract actionable insights into customer behavior and product relationships.
